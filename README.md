unsubscribe
---

I'm just making a list of email subscriptions that I unscribe and dates to see if they really do unsubscribe me.

* REI - June 6, 2016
* Netflix - June 6, 2016
* Hulu - Checked again and suppose to be unsubscribed but still receiving them.
* Match.com - June 6, 2016 but pretty sure I've opted out many of times in the past.
* Ubi.com - June 6, 2016
* DavidKinde.com - June 6, 2016
